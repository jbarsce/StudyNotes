# Personal study notes repo

Hey there! I use this repo to put down references, notes and summaries of fundamentals and concepts I like to have at hand in the future to return to them later, or as an alternative way to refresh them. They include machine learning, reinforcement learning, some math fundamentals I like to have at hand, and some concepts of computer science in general.

There is a lot of ToDo work, but I'm making this public as it is in the case it can be of help. I also plan to make short code implementations of some of the concepts for fun, learning or teaching.
